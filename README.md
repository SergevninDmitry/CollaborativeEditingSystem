# Collaborative Editing System

A microservice-based collaborative document editing platform built with **FastAPI**, **PostgreSQL**, and **Docker**.

The system allows users to:

- register and authenticate
- create and manage documents
- collaborate via document sharing
- maintain document version history
- revert and compare document versions

The project demonstrates a production-style backend architecture using service separation, API Gateway, and async communication between services.

---

## Architecture Overview

The system is built using a microservice architecture with a centralized API Gateway:

### Services

| Service | Responsibility                                                      |
|---|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **API Gateway** | Single entry point, authentication forwarding and  request proxying |
| **Auth Service** | Authentication & JWT issuing                                        |
| **User Service** | User management                                                     |
| **Document Service** | Document ownership & sharing                                        |
| **Version Service** | Document versioning and diff/revert logic                           |
| **PostgreSQL** | Shared database                                                     |

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

- **Backend**:
  - FastAPI
  - Python 3.11
  - SQLAlchemy (Async)

- **Infrastructure**:
  - Docker & Docker Compose
  - PostgreSQL

- **Communication**:
  - httpx (async HTTP clients)
  - JWT Authentication

- **Frontend**:
  - Streamlit

## Project Structure
```
services/
│
├── api_gateway/
├── auth_service/
├── user_service/
├── document_service/
└── version_service/

frontend/
shared/
docker-compose.yml
.env.example
```

### Layered service structure

Each service follows a consistent internal architecture:
```
service/
├── api/ # FastAPI routers
├── application/ # business logic (services)
├── infrastructure/ # DB models, integrations
├── dependencies.py
├── config.py
└── main.py

```
Each service is independently deployable and communicates via HTTP APIs.

---

## Quick Start

### Clone repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SergevninDmitry/CollaborativeEditingSystem.git
cd CollaborativeEditingSystem
```
### Create environment file
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

### To run containers in background
```bash
docker compose up --build
```

### Open applications
| Service | URL |
|---|---|
| API Gateway | http://localhost:8080/docs |
| Streamlit UI | http://localhost:8501 |


---

## Running Tests

The project contains a full testing setup covering:

-  **Unit tests** — business logic validation
-  **Integration tests** — API + database behavior
-  **Contract tests** — inter-service HTTP communication

Each microservice is tested independently while also supporting
running the entire test suite from the project root.

---

## Run All Tests

From project root using helper script:

### Linux / macOS

```bash
bash run_tests.sh
```
### Windows
```bash
.\run_tests.ps1
```

### Test Environment

- Tests use:
  - in-memory SQLite database (sqlite+aiosqlite:///:memory:)
  - dependency overrides (FastAPI DI)
  - fake HTTP clients for external services
  - respx for HTTP mocking

No Docker containers are required to run tests.
## Authentication Flow

1. User registers via User Service
2. Login request goes through API Gateway
3. Auth Service validates credentials
4. A JWT access token is issued.
5. The token must be included in the `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header for protected endpoints.


## Document Workflow

- Users create documents
- Documents belong to an owner
- Documents can be shared with other users
- Every modification creates a version snapshot
- Versions support:
  - history viewing
  - revert
  - diff comparison

## Versioning Logic

- The Version Service provides:
  - optimistic concurrency control
  - version history
  - unified diff generation
  - revert-to-version functionality


## Future Improvements

- WebSocket real-time editing
- Operational Transform / CRDT
- Redis caching layer
- Background workers
- Kubernetes deployment

## Educational Goals

This project demonstrates:
- microservice architecture design
- async Python backend development
- API Gateway pattern
- dependency injection in FastAPI
- service isolation
- production-style Docker setup
